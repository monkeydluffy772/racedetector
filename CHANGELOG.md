## [0.6.0] - 2025-12-11

### Fixed

**Unsynchronized Access Detection - COMPLETE**
- **GoStart/GoEnd instrumentation**: Proper VectorClock inheritance from parent to child goroutines
  - Parent's clock is snapshotted at `go func()` statement
  - Child inherits parent's clock, establishing happens-before edge
  - Fixes false negatives for `x = 42; go func() { _ = x }()` patterns
- **SmartTrack TOCTOU race fix**: Added `CompareAndSwapExclusiveWriter()` for atomic ownership claim
  - Two goroutines could both see `exclusiveWriter=0` and take fast path
  - CAS ensures only one goroutine claims ownership, other falls through to HB check
  - Fixes ~7% intermittent false negative rate
- **Spawn Context FIFO ordering**: Changed from `sync.Map` to `slice+mutex`
  - `sync.Map.Range()` iterates non-deterministically
  - Slice ensures first spawn matches first child (correct clock inheritance)
- **sync.Map reassignment race**: Changed `Init()`/`Reset()` to clear maps via `Range+Delete`
  - Reassigning `contexts = sync.Map{}` races with goroutines still accessing the map
  - Fixes panics during test suite runs

**Test Reliability: 70% -> 100%**
- All 4 previously skipped tests now pass consistently
- 20/20 test suite runs passing

### Added

**Go Race Test Suite - 100% Coverage**
- **359/359 test scenarios** ported from official Go race detector test suite
  - 355 scenarios from Go 1.21 test suite
  - 4 scenarios from Go 1.25.3 (non-inline comparison tests)
- **355 tests passing** (98.88% pass rate)
- **4 tests skipped** (known detector limitations - unsync access tracking)
- **21 test category files** organized by pattern type:
  - Basic, Mutex, Channel, Sync primitives
  - Memory, Patterns, Lifecycle, Atomic
  - Issues, Reflect, Advanced, String
  - Complex, Append, Defer/Panic
  - TypeAssert, Method, Range, Final
  - Compare (Go 1.25+ non-inline comparisons)

**Test Patterns Covered:**
- Write-write races, read-write races
- Mutex synchronization (same/different mutexes)
- Channel synchronization
- WaitGroup, Cond, Once, Pool
- Struct fields, slices, maps, arrays
- Closures, defer, panic/recover
- Type assertions, interfaces
- Atomic operations simulation
- Range loops, method receivers

## [0.5.2] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- **Corrected goid offsets for all Go versions**: The `gobuf.ret` field was removed in
  Go 1.25, changing the goid offset:
  - Go 1.23: offset **160** (gobuf=56 bytes, 7 fields including `ret`)
  - Go 1.24: offset **160** (gobuf=56 bytes, 7 fields including `ret`)
  - Go 1.25: offset **152** (gobuf=48 bytes, 6 fields, `ret` removed)
- Fixed `goid_go124.go` offset from incorrect 152 to correct **160**
- Updated release workflow to use Go 1.25 (matches go.mod 1.24+ requirement)
- Fixed `.golangci.yml` pattern for `goid_go*.go` files

---

## [0.5.1] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

- **Version-specific goid files**: Replaced single `goid_fast.go` with version-specific:
  - `goid_go123.go` - Go 1.23 support
  - `goid_go124.go` - Go 1.24 support
  - `goid_go125.go` - Go 1.25 support
- Note: This release had incorrect offset for Go 1.24 (fixed in v0.5.2)

---

## [0.5.0] - 2025-12-10

**Performance Breakthrough: ~2200x Faster Goroutine ID Extraction!**

This release introduces native assembly implementation for goroutine ID extraction,
eliminating the runtime.Stack parsing overhead on supported platforms.

### Added

**Assembly-Optimized GID Extraction**
- **goid_amd64.s**: Native assembly for x86-64 using TLS access
  - `MOVQ (TLS), R14` to get g pointer from Thread Local Storage
  - Zero allocations, ~1.73 ns/op
- **goid_arm64.s**: Native assembly for ARM64 using dedicated g register
  - `MOVD g, R0` to read g pointer from R28 register
  - Zero allocations, ~2 ns/op
- **goid_go123.go / goid_go124.go / goid_go125.go**: Version-specific Go wrappers
  - Reads goid at correct offset for each Go version
  - Go 1.23: offset 160, Go 1.24/1.25: offset 152
  - Automatic fallback to runtime.Stack on nil g pointer
- **goid_fallback.go**: Fallback for unsupported platforms
  - Used on Go <1.23, Go >=1.26, or non-amd64/arm64 architectures
  - Uses runtime.Stack parsing (~3987 ns/op)

### Performance

| Method | Time | Allocations | Speedup |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| Assembly (amd64) | 1.73 ns/op | 0 B/op | ~2200x |
| Assembly (arm64) | ~2 ns/op | 0 B/op | ~2000x |
| runtime.Stack | 3987 ns/op | 64 B/op | baseline |

### Technical Details

**Build Constraints:**
```go
//go:build go1.23 && !go1.24 && (amd64 || arm64)  // for Go 1.23
//go:build go1.24 && !go1.25 && (amd64 || arm64)  // for Go 1.24
//go:build go1.25 && !go1.26 && (amd64 || arm64)  // for Go 1.25
```

**g struct goid offset calculation:**
```
Go 1.24/1.25 (gobuf=48 bytes):
  goid at offset 152

Go 1.23 (gobuf=56 bytes):
  goid at offset 160
```

### Changed

- **goid_generic.go**: Refactored to provide common utilities
  - `getGoroutineID()` - main entry point
  - `getGoroutineIDSlow()` - runtime.Stack fallback
  - `parseGID()` - optimized byte parsing (no regex, no allocations)
- **.golangci.yml**: Added exclusion for govet unsafeptr check on goid files
- **scripts/pre-release-check.sh**: Added `-unsafeptr=false` flag for go vet

### Removed

- No external dependencies for goroutine ID extraction
- outrigdev/goid dependency was evaluated but rejected in favor of own implementation

### Why Own Implementation?

Strategic decision: **Zero external dependencies for Go runtime proposal!**
- If Go team accepts this detector into runtime, it's their responsibility to maintain GID extraction
- External dependency would complicate acceptance into official Go toolchain
- Our implementation is smaller and tailored specifically for race detector needs

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.5.1
```

## [0.4.10] - 2025-12-10

### Fix: Run go mod tidy in src directory

This release fixes the missing go.sum entries for racedetector.

### Fixed

- **"missing go.sum entry for module providing package"**
  - After adding racedetector require to src/go.mod, go.sum was outdated
  - Now running `go mod tidy` in src/ directory to update go.sum

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.10
```

---

## [0.4.9] - 2025-12-10

### Fix: Add racedetector dependency to instrumented go.mod

This release fixes the missing racedetector dependency in the instrumented module.

### Fixed

- **"no required module provides package github.com/kolkov/racedetector/race"**
  - Instrumented code imports `racedetector/race`, but src/go.mod (copy of original) didn't have this dependency
  - Now appending `require github.com/kolkov/racedetector VERSION` to src/go.mod

### Changed

- **Added `runtime.Version` constant** for consistent version management
- **`instrumentTestSources()`** now adds racedetector require to src/go.mod
- **`ModFileOverlay()`** now uses `runtime.Version` constant

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.9
```

---

## [0.4.8] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: Copy go.mod to instrumented sources

This hotfix ensures the instrumented source directory is a valid Go module.

### Fixed

- **go mod tidy fails: "reading src/go.mod: no such file or directory"**
  - The `replace MODULE => ./src` directive requires `./src` to be a valid module
  - Now copying original go.mod to workspace/src/ directory
  - This allows `go mod tidy` to resolve the replace directive correctly

### Changed

- **`instrumentTestSources()`** now copies go.mod to srcDir before go.sum

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.8
```

---

## [0.4.7] - 2025-12-10

### Feature: Internal Module Import Resolution

This release fixes internal import resolution for multi-package modules.

### Fixed

- **Issue #10: Internal module imports not rewritten during instrumentation**
  - Imports like `github.com/MODULE/subpackage` now resolve correctly
  - Added `replace MODULE => ./src` directive to instrumented go.mod
  - This allows internal packages to find each other in the temp workspace

### Changed

- **`ModFileOverlay()`** now adds replace directive for original module
  - Reads module name from original go.mod via new `getModuleName()` function
  - Skips adding replace for racedetector's own module (avoids conflicts)

- **New function `getModuleName()`** - extracts module path from go.mod

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.7
```

---

## [0.4.6] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: Ultra-Conservative Identifier Handling

This hotfix takes an ultra-conservative approach to identifier instrumentation to fix remaining edge cases.

### Fixed

- **Issue #9 (final): Comprehensive identifier filtering**
  - `IsValidationError (func)` - functions from other files had nil Obj
  - `commandBufferMarker (type)` - types from other packages had nil Obj
  - `generic type ID without instantiation` - generic type parameters
  - `undefined: val` - scope issues with identifiers

### Changed

- **Ultra-conservative Ident handling in `shouldInstrument()`**
  - ONLY instrument identifiers with `ident.Obj != nil && ident.Obj.Kind == ast.Var`
  - Skip ALL identifiers where we cannot confirm they are variables
  - This eliminates false positives from functions, types, generics, etc.

- **New AST handlers in `extractReads()`**
  - `*ast.TypeAssertExpr` - skip Type, only walk into X
  - `*ast.FuncLit` - skip anonymous function bodies (separate scope)

### Limitations

- Only local variables (same file) are instrumented
- Package-level variables from other files may be missed
- This is a trade-off for correctness over coverage
- Full type-checking integration needed for complete coverage

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.6
```

---

## [0.4.5] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: CompositeLit, CallExpr and Generic Functions

This hotfix properly handles composite literals, function calls, and generic function instantiations.

### Fixed

- **Issue #9 (final fix): Type expressions in composite literals**
  - `Surface (type) is not an expression` - type names in `Type{...}` were being instrumented
  - Added CompositeLit handling in `extractReads()` - skip Type, only walk into Elts

- **Function calls and type conversions**
  - Skip Fun part of CallExpr (could be function, method, or type conversion)
  - Only instrument the arguments

- **Generic function instantiation**
  - `cannot use generic function without instantiation` error
  - Skip IndexListExpr entirely (generic type params like `Func[T, U]`)

### Changed

- **`extractReads()` now handles additional AST node types:**
  - `*ast.CompositeLit` - skip Type, walk into Elts only
  - `*ast.CallExpr` - skip Fun, walk into Args only
  - `*ast.IndexListExpr` - skip entirely (generic instantiation)

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.5
```

---

## [0.4.4] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: Conservative SelectorExpr & Struct Literals

This hotfix takes a more conservative approach to instrumentation, fixing remaining edge cases that caused compilation errors.

### Fixed

- **Issue #9 (continued): More SelectorExpr edge cases**
  - Method values: `hub.GetAdapter`, `result.String`
  - Return value fields: `GetGlobal().Hub`
  - Package-qualified identifiers with non-stdlib packages
  - Undefined identifiers in complex expressions

- **Struct literal field names**
  - Field names in struct literals (`Point{X: 1, Y: 2}`) were incorrectly treated as variables
  - Added KeyValueExpr handling in `extractReads()` to skip field names
  - Only the value expressions are now instrumented

### Changed

- **Skip ALL SelectorExpr** in `shouldInstrument()`
  - Without full type information, too many non-addressable cases exist
  - This is a trade-off: may miss some struct field race conditions
  - Safer than breaking compilation on valid code

- **Removed `isLikelyPackageName()`** - no longer needed with conservative approach

- **Added KeyValueExpr handling** in `extractReads()`
  - Key (field name) is skipped
  - Value expression is still walked for instrumentation

### Limitations

- Struct field access via dot notation (`obj.Field`) is not instrumented
- This reduces detection coverage but ensures correctness
- Full type-checking integration planned for future release

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.4
```

---

## [0.4.3] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: Package Functions & Map Index Support

This hotfix resolves remaining instrumentation errors with package function calls and map index expressions.

### Fixed

- **Package function calls** (`os.ReadFile`, `strconv.Atoi`, `filepath.Join`, etc.)
  - Added `isLikelyPackageName()` heuristic to detect standard library packages
  - SelectorExpr now properly filtered when X is a package identifier

- **Map index expressions** (`map[key]`)
  - Cannot take address of map element in Go
  - All IndexExpr now skipped (conservative approach without type info)
  - This may miss some slice/array race conditions, but avoids compilation errors

### Changed

- **`shouldInstrument()`** now handles additional expression types:
  - `*ast.SelectorExpr` - skip package.Function patterns
  - `*ast.IndexExpr` - skip all index expressions (maps not addressable)

- **New function `isLikelyPackageName()`** - heuristic for common stdlib packages

### Limitations

- IndexExpr on slices/arrays is now skipped (false negatives possible)
- Custom package names not in stdlib list may still cause issues
- Full type-checking would be needed for 100% accuracy

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.3
```

---

## [0.4.2] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: Function References & Built-in Support

This hotfix resolves instrumentation errors when code contains function references, built-in functions, or type conversions.

### Fixed

- **Issue #9: Instrumentation breaks function references** ([#9](https://github.com/kolkov/racedetector/issues/9))
  - Root cause: `shouldInstrument()` didn't filter functions, types, packages, or built-ins
  - Fix: Added comprehensive filtering for all non-addressable expressions
  - Errors fixed:
    - `cannot take address of <function> (value of type func(...))`
    - `make (built-in) must be called`
    - `string (type) is not an expression`

### Changed

- **`isBuiltinIdent()`** now includes all Go built-in functions and types:
  - Built-in functions: `make`, `new`, `len`, `cap`, `append`, `copy`, `delete`, `close`, `panic`, `recover`, `print`, `println`, `complex`, `real`, `imag`, `clear`, `min`, `max`
  - Built-in types: `int`, `int8-64`, `uint`, `uint8-64`, `float32`, `float64`, `complex64`, `complex128`, `bool`, `byte`, `rune`, `string`, `error`, `any`, `comparable`, `uintptr`

- **`shouldInstrument()`** now checks `ast.Obj.Kind` to skip:
  - `ast.Fun` - function identifiers
  - `ast.Typ` - type identifiers
  - `ast.Pkg` - package identifiers

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.2
```

---

## [0.4.1] - 2025-12-10

### Hotfix: CI Environment Support

This hotfix resolves `racedetector test` failures in GitHub Actions and other CI environments.

### Fixed

- **Issue #8: `racedetector test` fails in CI** ([#8](https://github.com/kolkov/racedetector/issues/8))
  - Root cause: `ModFileOverlay()` returned empty string in "published mode" (when installed via `go install`)
  - Fix: Now always creates `go.mod` in workspace, using published package version in CI
  - Error: `directory prefix . does not contain main module` is now resolved

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.1
```

---

## [0.4.0] - 2025-12-09

### `racedetector test` Command Release

This release introduces the `test` command - a drop-in replacement for `go test -race` that works with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

### Added

- **`racedetector test` command** - Run tests with race detection without CGO
  - All `go test` flags supported: `-v`, `-run`, `-bench`, `-cover`, `-coverprofile`, `-timeout`, `-count`, `-parallel`, `-tags`, `-ldflags`, etc.
  - Recursive package patterns: `./...`, `./pkg/...`, `./internal/...`
  - Test files (`_test.go`) properly instrumented alongside source files
  - Works exactly like `go test -race` but without CGO requirement

### Fixed

- **Critical: IncDecStmt instrumentation** - `counter++` and `counter--` operations now properly instrumented
  - Both READ and WRITE operations are detected for increment/decrement
  - Code inside anonymous functions (`go func() {...}()`) now instrumented correctly
  - This fix enables detection of races that were previously missed

- **findProjectRoot() improvement** - No longer confuses user's go.mod with racedetector's
  - Uses `internal/race/api` directory marker for accurate detection
  - Added executable path fallback for installed binaries
  - Fixes "module does not contain package" errors

### Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
racedetector test ./...

# With flags
racedetector test -v -run TestFoo ./pkg/...
racedetector test -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
racedetector test -bench . -benchmem ./...
```

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.4.0
```

## [0.3.2] - 2025-12-01

### Go 1.24+ Requirement & Replace Directive Fix

This hotfix release upgrades the minimum Go version to 1.24 and fixes handling of `replace` directives in go.mod files.

### Changed

- **BREAKING: Minimum Go version is now 1.24** (was 1.21)
  - Go 1.24 provides significant performance improvements (Swiss Tables maps, improved sync.Map)
  - Better runtime performance benefits race detection workloads
  - Users requiring Go 1.21 support can use v0.3.1

### Fixed

- **Issue #6: Replace directives not working** ([#6](https://github.com/kolkov/racedetector/issues/6))
  - `replace` directives from original project's go.mod are now properly copied to instrumented code
  - Relative paths (e.g., `../locallib`) are automatically converted to absolute paths
  - Supports all replace directive formats (with/without version specifiers)

### Added

- **New dependency: golang.org/x/mod v0.30.0**
  - Official Go module for parsing go.mod files
  - Enables proper handling of replace directives
- **New functions in runtime package:**
  - `findOriginalGoMod()` - Locates project's go.mod file
  - `extractReplaceDirectives()` - Parses and converts replace directives
  - `isLocalPath()` - Detects local filesystem paths

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.3.2
```

**Note:** Requires Go 1.24 or higher.

### Upgrade from v0.3.1

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-19

### 🎉 First Production Release - Race Detector WORKS!

This is the **first working release** of the Pure-Go Race Detector! The detector successfully catches real data races in concurrent Go code without requiring CGO.

### Added

**Phase 6A - Standalone Tool (Complete):**
- AST-based code instrumentation with race call insertion ✅
- Automatic race package import injection ✅
- `race.Init()` insertion at program start ✅
- `racedetector build` command (drop-in replacement for `go build`) ✅
- `racedetector run` command (drop-in replacement for `go run`) ✅
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows) ✅
- Dogfooding demo (tool tests itself) ✅

**Phase 2 - Refinement (Complete):**
- Smart instrumentation filtering (skips constants, built-ins, literals, blank identifier)
- Professional error messages with file:line:column
- Verbose mode (`-v`) with instrumentation statistics
- 5-15% overhead reduction through smart filtering

**Runtime Implementation:**
- FastTrack algorithm (PLDI 2009) ✅
- Detector with write/read race detection ✅
- Shadow memory tracking ✅
- Vector clocks for happens-before relationships ✅
- Adaptive epoch ↔ vector clock switching (260x memory savings) ✅
- Sync primitive tracking (Mutex, Channel, WaitGroup) ✅
- Production-quality race reports with stack traces ✅
- Race deduplication (no report spam) ✅

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive installation guide (INSTALLATION.md)
- Complete usage guide (USAGE_GUIDE.md)
- Example programs (mutex_protected, channel_sync)
- Security policy (SECURITY.md)
- Contributing guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Upgraded from v0.1.0-alpha (proof-of-concept) to v0.1.0 (production-ready)
- AST instrumentation now actually inserts race detection calls (was TODO)
- Error messages now include file:line:column and suggestions
- Build command now supports `-v` flag for verbose statistics

### Fixed

- AST instrumentation now correctly handles `:=` (DEFINE token)
- Constants, literals, and built-ins no longer instrumented (reduces false positives)
- Blank identifier `_` no longer instrumented (prevents "cannot use _ as value" errors)
- Race detection calls now properly inserted BEFORE memory accesses

### Performance

- Hot path overhead: 15-22%
- Instrumentation overhead: 5-15% reduction through smart filtering
- Real-world workloads: 368-809ns/op
- Zero allocations on hot paths
- Scalability: 1000+ goroutines tested

### Statistics

- **Production Code:** 22,653 lines (22,273 + 380 from Phase 2)
- **Test Code:** 970+ lines (850 + 120 from Phase 2)
- **Documentation:** 25,601 lines
- **Total:** 49,224+ lines (code + docs)
- **Tests:** 70+ tests passing (100% pass rate)
- **Coverage:** 45-92% across packages

### Validation

**Simple Race Test:**
```bash
$ racedetector build examples/dogfooding/simple_race.go
$ ./simple_race
==================
WARNING: DATA RACE
Write at 0x000000c00000a0b8 by goroutine 4:
  ...
Previous Write at 0x000000c00000a0b8 by goroutine 3:
  ...
==================
```

✅ **DETECTOR WORKS!** Successfully detects real data races!

### Known Limitations

This release provides a fully functional race detector, but some advanced features are planned for future versions:

- Stack traces show current access only (previous access placeholder)
- Limited to memory access races (sync primitive races in progress)
- Performance overhead higher than Go's official race detector (15-22% vs 5-10%)

### Installation

```bash
go install github.com/kolkov/racedetector/cmd/racedetector@v0.1.0
```

### Usage

```bash
# Build with race detection
racedetector build main.go

# Build with verbose statistics
racedetector build -v main.go

# Run with race detection
racedetector run main.go
```

### Project Timeline

- Path A: November 19, 2025 (target: December 15, 2025)
- Phase 2: November 19, 2025
- Path B: January 31, 2026 (planned)
- Go Proposal: Q2 2026 (planned)
